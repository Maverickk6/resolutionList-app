  This is a sample app demonstrating the basics of the Meteor framework and its capabilities.
  
Meteor being a framework which seeks to eliminate the divide between the server and client.
In advantages, it eliminates the need for manual API implementation and with its integration with MongoDB.

  This app is a simple resolutions list app featuring user authentication, and privacy options depending on
the user's discretion. This app merges seamlessly with the react front end framework which was used in
rendering the app's content to the webpage.

  MongoDB is the standard factory choice of database as it ships in by default with every meteor installation.
This app demonstrates the account management features of meteor and thus users can create accounts and
log in, make their posts private or allow them to be viewed publicly. 
The account usernames are appended to
the posts from each account, and only users who are logged in to their accounts can delete their posts.

great framework.
